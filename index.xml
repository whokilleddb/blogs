      <description>Rant as an Introduction When initially getting into ETW and patching it, I was not prepared for what was coming. It was a deep rabbit hole of .NET, CLR and Windows Internals. Coming from a pure-C background(and a bit of Rust), this was a deep hole I was not prepared for at all. This blog is supposed to be more of a Journal than a tutorial as I try to figure things out!</description>

      <title>A Study In Obfuscation</title>
      <link>https://whokilleddb.github.io/blogs/posts/a_study_in_obfuscation/</link>

      <guid>https://whokilleddb.github.io/blogs/posts/a_study_in_obfuscation/</guid>
      <description>Introduction In this blog series, we explore how to obfuscate a Metasploit payload to avoid detection by Antivirus Engines and shall try to go invisible. We would start from the ground up: Using a completely unobfuscated shellcode, and try to build upon it till we reach zero detections. All the associated code for this blog can be found in this Github repository.
We would employ known techniques and see how they affect detection rates uploading the compiled executable to AntiScan as it does not submit the samples to the vendors.</description>

      <title>CVE-2022-38258: DLink DIR 819 LFI And DoS</title>
      <link>https://whokilleddb.github.io/blogs/posts/dlink_dir-819_lfi_and_dos/</link>

      <description>Introduction D-Link is one of the leading brands when it comes to manufacturing consumer routers. There&amp;rsquo;s a fair chance that you have a D-Link router back at home. The D-Link DIR 819 model is a very popular router.
In this blog post, I explain how I found a Local-File-Inclusion 0day, now designated as CVE-2022-38258, and escalated it to achieve a Denial-of-Service attack. Though the blog is written with respect to the DIR-819 model, it should be reproduceable on any router running the same firmware.</description>
